- Hat tip to anyone whose code was used
- We were heavily inspired by softwares such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and [Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR)
- We also used a lot of [Youtube](youtube.com) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for coding help and instruction. Our earliest developers also used [Oriley](https://learning.oreilly.com/home/) for coding classes
